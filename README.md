# Categorical Data Analysis in Python
## Chapter 1 - Understand your variables
   * Lesson 1.1 - Introduction to variables
     * A learning objective: Learn about variable types: categorical, nominal, quantitative.
   * Lesson 1.2 - Working with pandas
     * A learning objective: Create basic pandas Series and Dataframes, use category dtype and CategoricalDtype.
   * Lesson 1.3 - Exploration
     * A learning objective: Visualize data via bar chart, pie chart.
## Chapter 2 - Working with categorical data
   * Lesson 2.1 - Modifying categories
     * A learning objective: adding, renaming, removing categories
   * Lesson 2.2 - Ordering and sorting
     * A learning objective: bestowe a meaning on the order of categories, sort values
   * Lesson 2.3 - Comparing categories
     * A learning objective: Since categories are now ordered, we can compare categorical data
   * Lesson 2.4 - Operations
     * A learning objective: Run functions such as min, max, groupby
## Chapter 3 - Using categorical data in ML
   * Lesson 3.1 - Understand the use in models
     * A learning objective: Explain encodings and how they are used in e.g. decision trees and regression
   * Lesson 3.2 - Encoding with pandas
     * A learning objective: create dummy values, pd.get_dummies, one-hot-encoding
   * Lesson 3.3 - Encoding with scikit-learn
     * A learning objective: Use sklearn.preprocessing, OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder, OrdinalEncoder 
## Chapter 4 - Use case
   * Lesson 4.1 - Problem description
     * A learning objective: Get data from CSV, take a look at the data, create categories
   * Lesson 4.2 - Construct model
     * A learning objective: Use scikit-learn and its DecisionTreeClassifier to fit data
   * Lesson 4.3 - Interpretation
     * A learning objective: Visualize the decision tree and understand how categorical data has been fit.
